Welcome to the documentation for **OpenResty Operator** —  
a lightweight Kubernetes Operator that turns OpenResty into a declarative, GitOps-native internal API gateway.

OpenResty Operator helps teams proxy and manage third-party APIs efficiently inside Kubernetes.  
It supports CRD-based configurations for `Location`, `ServerBlock`, and `Upstream`, and integrates seamlessly with Prometheus, GitOps workflows, and hot-reloadable Nginx configurations.

This documentation covers everything you need to install, configure, and operate OpenResty Operator in production.
